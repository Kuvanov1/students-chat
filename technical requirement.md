# **Technical Requirements for Student Chat Platform (MVP 1\)**

## **1\. Overview**

The Student Chat Platform allows university students to communicate with each other based on their university, course, and interests. The platform includes user authentication, chat functionality, and friend discovery.

## **2\. Functional Requirements**

### **2.1 User Management**

* Users must be able to register with their **first name, last name, email, password, university, and course**.  
* Users must log in using **email and password**.  
* Passwords must be securely hashed before storing.  
* Users must be able to update their **profile picture and personal information**.

### **2.2 Friend Discovery**

* Users can search for others based on **university and course**.  
* Users can send **friend requests** to connect with other students.  
* Users can accept or decline **friend requests**.  
* Users can view their list of **friends**.

### **2.3 Chat System**

* Users can engage in **1-on-1** and **group** chats.  
* Group chats should have a **name** and **multiple members**.  
* Users can send and receive **text messages**.  
* Messages should be **stored in the database** and retrieved when needed.  
* Users should see a list of their **recent conversations**.

### **2.4 Notifications**

* Users receive notifications for:  
  * New **friend requests**.  
  * Accepted friend requests.  
  * New messages in their chats.  
* Notifications should be **marked as read** once viewed.

### **2.5 Security**

* Passwords must be stored using **bcrypt** hashing.  
* JWT (JSON Web Token) should be used for **authentication**.  
* Users can **reset their password** via email verification.

## **3\. Non-Functional Requirements**

### **3.1 Performance**

* The platform should support **up to 1,000 concurrent users**.  
* Chats should have a **low latency** (under 1 second message delivery time).

### **3.2 Scalability**

* The system should be **horizontally scalable** to handle increased load.  
* WebSocket should be considered for real-time messaging.

### **3.3 Maintainability**

* The backend and frontend should be **modular** and follow **MVC architecture**.  
* Code should be **well-documented** and follow best practices.

## **4\. Technology Stack**

### **4.1 Backend**

* **Programming Language**: Python (Django / FastAPI) or Node.js (Express.js)  
* **Database**: PostgreSQL  
* **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Token)  
* **Real-time Chat**: WebSockets (Socket.io or Django Channels)

### **4.2 Frontend**

* **Framework**: React.js (Next.js recommended)  
* **State Management**: Redux or Context API  
* **UI Library**: TailwindCSS / Bootstrap

### **4.3 Infrastructure**

* **Hosting**: AWS / DigitalOcean / Vercel  
* **Storage**: AWS S3 for profile pictures  
* **Messaging Queue**: Redis (optional for notifications)  
* **Logging & Monitoring**: Sentry / LogRocket

## **5\. Deployment Plan**

### **5.1 Development Environment**

* Local development with PostgreSQL and Node.js/Django backend.  
* Docker setup for easy local development.

### **5.2 Staging Environment**

* Hosted on a test server for internal testing.

### **5.3 Production Deployment**

* CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD.  
* Auto-scaling infrastructure for handling large user traffic.

## **6\. Future Enhancements (Beyond MVP 1\)**

* **File sharing** in chats.  
* **Video & voice calls** integration.  
* **Advanced search filters** based on interests and skills.  
* **AI-based matching** to suggest friends.
